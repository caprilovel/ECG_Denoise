## Abstract 

Cardiovascular disease, a major life-threatening condition, is now commonly monitored using electrocardiogram(ECG) signals. However, the ECG signals currently generated by sensors are often accompanied by a plethora of diverse types of noise with different intensities, which causes a lot of interference in downstream task. Therefore, it is essential to denoise the ECG signal for further analysis.  In order to eliminate different types of noise, we propose a deep learning method for denoising that is specifically designed for address different types of noise.  Due to the different frequency characteristics of different types of noise, we use a Transformer with local enhancement as a feature extractor which can capture global dependencies. In addition, we introduce an R-wave attention mechanism to improve R-wave reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in denoising different types of strong noise, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
